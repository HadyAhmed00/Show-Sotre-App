# Show-Sotre-App

It is an porject to apply what I learn in the Android [Kotlin Developer Nanodegree from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940?campaign_name=laborday&coupon=LABORDAY22&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=12908932988_c_individuals_labour&utm_term=124509202311&utm_keyword=%2Budacity%20%2Bandroid_b&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_medium=ads_r&utm_campaign=12908932988_c_individuals&utm_term=124509202311&utm_keyword=%2Budacity%20%2Bandroid_b&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpeaYBhDXARIsAEzItbFr09oN0kXe3sJ8KnKzJwozh8uKFo6hx2bbABsWCytxFFzYjgTHANUaAup1EALw_wcB) 

## Lessons

If you follow all the lessons :
* Build your First App, 
* Layouts, App Navigation, 
* Activity & Fragment Lifecycle, 
* and App Architecture UI Layer) 
<br>
in this course, you shouldn't have any problem to complete this project. It is pretty straight forward except for listing screen (will be explained later).

## App contant

There are a total of 5 screens here 
* login
* welcome
* instructions
* listing
* detail screens.

## What I learned?

* ViewModel and Live Data (observe live data and setup click listener)
* Single Activity Architecture (implement multiple fragments and navigate between them with transition animation)
* SafeArgs (pass data between fragment using bundle)
* Layout Design with sytles.xml (use ConstraintLayout and standardize the design style across different layouts)
* Data binding in layouts (implement both 1-way and 2-way data binding - e.g. in EditView)
* ScrollView (dynamically insert item into ScrollView during runtime)
* Logout Menu (implement menu at the top left corner of the phone)
